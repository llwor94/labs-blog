# Overview

This week has been crazy. I feel like there have been so many highs and lows in this project. Working with it in development with the slow build times from nextjs makes it easy to feel like the app sucks and is slow and bad which has felt pretty stressful. All in all though, we are SO close to the finish line and I'm becoming really excited about the final product. I wish we had more than 5 weeks honestly, there's so many more features I want to implement in this app, but we just don't have the time. This week I set up cloudinary so that a user can import images from facebook, instagram, or locally. I set up the profile page so that a user can upload multiple pictures and delete them and change their default image. I got the new message notification set up in the header, set up chat in the modal, set up a password reset page, and set up a welcome screen thing.

# In depth analysis (ticket 4)

So I was pretty unhappy with the new user modal, it just wasn't up to par and I couldn't figure out how to make it look good. On a whim today I decided to ditch the modal and go for a completely different approach, and I'm beyond happy with it. I set up a welcome section that's 8 pages long, and that took me a good amount of the evening.

I used this lil conditional render thing from Material UI to display different screens based on the progress in the stepper below.

I was excited to play around with Router and check out some of it's features, and so I was pretty excited about this. The four props being passed here are the href, to easy pass a value in as a prop to the component, an 'as' url, which is what the url appears as in the browser (I love this feature), shallow variable which means we're not routing to a new page, and scroll false, meaning don't scroll when the url changes. Super fun! 

> As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to make your product look and feel as good as it works under the hood. Describe how the duties of you and your team shifted tasks shifted towards the front end - and debugging the back end to improve UX.

The duties have pretty much stayed the same. But it's really fun working together as a team to decide what we like and what we don't like ux/ui wise. I feel like we all have pretty similar taste, and we're also all not really willing to let it go if it doesnt look quite right, which is a great combo.
