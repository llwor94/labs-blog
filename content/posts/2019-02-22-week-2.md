# Overview

This week was awesome! We busted ass through MVP, and learning to work as a team has been a really cool/ difficult challenge. I'm loving the gang but feeling kind of paranoid that I'm slowing everyone down. This week I fixed scrolling, set up filters (genre and subgenre), tweaked the login/signup page to display specific errors, basically the entire front end except the billing page. Deployment with SSR has been crazy. I love labs lol.

## In depth analysis ( ticket 1 )

I'm realizing this is the second week I'm writing a ticket about auth... whewpz. I don't care though, I've spent a good amount of time on that page perfecting it so yolo! I'm gonna talk about it some more.

This is my lil error modal i built- it displays errors after the user hits submit from the server. I'm still playing around with what errors exactly I want to show here and which ones I want to show as a label. I think i might even end up abandoning this modal all together.

This is such a small little thing but i feel like it really makes a difference- we have password requirements set up on our passwords- 8 chars with 1 number. So if a user submits a password that doesn't fulfill that requirement, it shows the input as an error- the label is red and there's a red 'X' instead of the visibility toggle. THIS makes it so if the user receives this error, the second they start typing in that field the error goes away. Yay lil nitpicks! 

I only did 2 pics but here's a video of me working lol

# Weekly Question

> As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences forming a team. What did you do to help the team solidify as a group? What did you do that you now realize caused friction in this process? What are you doing personally to make sure that everyone on the team, including you, has a voice in decision making?

Man oh man is working on a team hard! I love all my team members and it's still been rough. It's hard if you're not in constant communication- I've been paranoid about  people working in the same file and merge conflicts. Also it's scary to lose something and not even realize that you've lost it until later... and then you're like what the heck else did i lose in that merge?! Anyway, I'm trying to make sure that I'm as communicative as possible, which is hard for me because I'm kind of a lone wolf when it comes to coding and like to just go go go. Tryin to step back and b chill has been rough but it's a great learning experience.
