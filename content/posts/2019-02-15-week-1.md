# Overview

This week has been interesting to say the least. They restricted our Github access over arbitrary details in the TDD, so we weren't able to to get started on our official repo until Wednesday. So far I've built the landing page, the login and logout modal which are both functioning and communicating with the backend, the page that displays events in your area which also communicates with the backend which communicates with the Eventful API, filters for the events, location tracking integrated with google api to retrieve search results based on your area, and set up the navbar to route to every page and also log the user out.

## In-depth analysis (ticket 4)

This project set-up was extremely time consuming as I spent a good amount of time reading about Nextjs and SSR, and trying to get the UI Kit we are using to render correctly with SSR. I've been learning quite a bit about new technologies and have felt the frustrations of that. On the other hand, I'm getting very comfortable with React hooks and Graphql.

I had fun with this little guy, still getting the feel for hooks and how I want to use them. This was the solution for a problem where I didn't like the UX experience of having 2 separate inputs for the users first and last name, however we wanted to store the first and last name separately in the db. Here I am checking in the onSubmit method whether there are two words or one in the name field, and then splitting them and sending them separately as the required fields. If the user name array has the length of 1, it displays an error.

Here I learned about refetching queries with graphql! I'm passing the refetch function into the Filter component, and then calling it from there whenever the category or date filters are updated in the `useEffect` method with new variables.

# Weekly Question

> As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your individual contributions to analyzing the project specification and writing the TDD. Describe the research you personally conducted to find out information on a competitor, investigate a technical solution to a specific problem, or define your customers.

I have been doing quite a bit of research on the APIs we are using. The MVP project we have been given is honestly a worse solution than any that already exist, so this part is a little difficult. We're literally using the API of one of our 'competitors'. However, once we're finished with MVP we have additions we would like to make to the project to make it into more of a real world application. I have been doing a lot of research on SSR rendering, and I just got a new Material UI kit that I've been spending a lot of time figuring out how to use. Excited to keep working on this!
