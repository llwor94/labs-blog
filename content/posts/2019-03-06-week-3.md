# Overview

This blog entry is super late : / Whoops. 

Last week we were supposed to be feature complete, but we had already been feature complete the week before, so we spent the week getting new features set up. I spent the week transforming the event card into a user card, setting up a modal for register to set a users profile picture/personal info, turned the dates page into a profile page, set up  frontend gender and age preferences, added a card flip to display compatible users on the back, changed a bunch of styling, made a new billing page, added liking/blocking on the front end, added a lil notification area to the header, and set up a notification query... I think that's it? Things went really great, love the team, having a great time building with them.

# In depth analysis (ticket 3)

I spent a while setting up the chat/messages on the front end. I've been having lots of fun with third party libraries this week! 

First I started with react-adopt, which takes all of your render prop components and shmooshes them into one to avoid nesting.

Then I discovered react-apollo-hooks, which eliminates your need for render props entirely by turning your mutations and queries into hooks.

I also got to play around with a Datepicker library, and use moment a heck ton.

> As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to convert a disparate set of components into a single, cohesive, and complete product. Describe the challenges you faced and the steps you took to overcome them.

I don't really know what this question means by a disparate set of components. Do you mean the front end and the back end? Those came  together pretty smoothly because one kind of relies on the other, so that wasn't a conversion of anything. We've all been kind of working on the same files on top of each other and it's going pretty well.
